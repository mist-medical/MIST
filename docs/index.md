Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit
===

## About
The Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST) is a simple, scalable, and end-to-end 3D medical imaging segmentation 
framework. MIST allows researchers to seamlessly train, evaluate, and deploy state-of-the-art deep learning models for 3D 
medical imaging segmentation.

## What's New
* November 2024 - MedNeXt models (small, base, medium, and large) added to MIST.
These models can be called with ```--model mednext-<small, base, medium, large>```.
* October 2024 - [MIST takes 3rd place in BraTS 2024 adult glioma challenge @ MICCAI 2024!](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn53708249/wiki/630150)
