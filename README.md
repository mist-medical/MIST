MIST is a simple, scalable, end-to-end framework for 3D medical image
segmentation. It handles everything from raw NIfTI files to trained models and
evaluated predictions, with sensible defaults that work well out of the box and
a configuration file for when you need more control.

## Installation

**CPU** (default — runs the full pipeline: train, predict, evaluate, everything):

```bash
pip install mist-medical
```

**NVIDIA GPU** (recommended — adds DALI-accelerated data loading):

```bash
pip install "mist-medical[dali]"
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!NOTE]
> Upgrading from an older MIST release? `pip install "mist-medical[train]"`
> still works too — it's kept as an identical alias for `[dali]`, so nothing
> in an existing script or notebook breaks.

**AMD ROCm GPU** (install a ROCm-enabled PyTorch build first — PyPI's default
`torch` wheel has no ROCm support — matching your driver's ROCm version, then
MIST on top with no extra needed; see
[Accelerator support](https://mist-medical.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_topics/#accelerator-support-nvidia-amd-rocm-cpu)
for details):

```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.4
pip install mist-medical
```

**Development**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mist-medical/MIST.git
cd MIST
pip install -e .            # CPU
pip install -e ".[dali]"    # NVIDIA GPU acceleration (recommended on CUDA)
```

**Docker** (NVIDIA GPU required, driver ≥ 525.x):

```bash
docker pull mistmedical/mist:latest
```

## Quick Start

**1. Prepare a dataset JSON** describing your data:

```json
{
  "task": "brats2023",
  "modality": "mr",
  "train-data": "/full/path/to/raw/data/train",
  "test-data": "/full/path/to/raw/data/validation",
  "mask": ["seg.nii.gz"],
  "images": {
    "t1": ["t1n.nii.gz"],
    "t2": ["t2w.nii.gz"],
    "tc": ["t1c.nii.gz"],
    "fl": ["t2f.nii.gz"]
  },
  "labels": [0, 1, 2, 3],
  "final_classes": { "WT": [1, 2, 3], "TC": [1, 3], "ET": [3] }
}
```

**2. Run the full pipeline** (analyze → preprocess → train → evaluate):

```bash
mist_run_all --data dataset.json \
             --numpy /path/to/numpy \
             --results /path/to/results
```

**3. Run inference** on new data:

```bash
mist_predict --models-dir /path/to/results/models \
             --config /path/to/results/config.json \
             --paths-csv /path/to/test.csv \
             --output /path/to/predictions
```

## Key Features

- **Automatic configuration** — analysis step determines target spacing, patch
  size, normalization, and foreground cropping from your data
- **Five-fold cross-validation** by default, with custom fold assignment support
- **Multi-GPU training** via PyTorch DDP on NVIDIA CUDA or AMD ROCm; uses all
  visible GPUs automatically
- **GPU-accelerated data loading** via NVIDIA DALI during training, with a
  generic CPU-based data loader used automatically on AMD ROCm or CPU-only
  hardware — no NVIDIA-specific dependencies required to train at all
- **Sliding window inference** with configurable overlap and patch blending
- **Test-time augmentation** and **multi-model ensembling** at inference
- **Postprocessing** with learnable, per-class morphological strategies
- **CPU training and inference** — the full pipeline, `mist_train` included,
  runs on any machine, including Macs and laptops without an NVIDIA GPU

## What's New

- October 2026 — **MIST 2.3.0, the first stable release** — MIST drops its
  release-candidate tag. 2.3.0 rolls up everything below since 2.0.2-rc: CPU and
  AMD ROCm training, `mist_finalize` for per-fold distributed training,
  probability-level and parallel ensembling, and the removal of the ANTs
  dependency. `pip install --upgrade mist-medical` to get it.
- September 2026 — **CPU and AMD ROCm training support** — the full pipeline,
  including `mist_train`, now runs on CPU-only machines and AMD ROCm GPUs via
  a new generic, pure-PyTorch data loader, auto-selected whenever NVIDIA
  DALI isn't the right fit for the detected hardware (or isn't installed).
  Communication backend (`nccl`/RCCL on ROCm, `gloo` on CPU) and data loader
  selection are both detected automatically and persisted to `config.json`.
  The `train` install extra is now called `dali`, to reflect that it gates
  DALI's CUDA acceleration specifically, not training capability in
  general — `pip install mist-medical` trains everywhere on its own;
  `pip install "mist-medical[dali]"` is recommended on top of that for
  NVIDIA GPU training. `[train]` is kept working as an alias for `[dali]`
  for anyone upgrading from an older release. AMP (BF16) is also now correctly
  scoped to hardware with real matrix acceleration — NVIDIA Ampere+ and AMD
  CDNA/RDNA3+ — rather than trusting `torch.cuda.is_bf16_supported()`, which
  reports available on older AMD RDNA1/2 GPUs despite having no BF16
  acceleration at all.
- September 2026 — **`mist_finalize` for distributed per-fold training** —
  `mist_train` now supports the one-fold-per-node HPC pattern: when an
  invocation's `--folds`/`training.folds` doesn't cover every configured fold,
  it writes out-of-fold predictions for the fold(s) it trained and prints a
  reminder instead of guessing at final results from a partial run. Run
  `mist_finalize --results <dir>` once, after every per-fold job sharing that
  results directory has finished, to aggregate every fold's held-out
  predictions into `results.csv` and run held-out test-set inference.
  `mist_finalize` is safe to re-run any time — each run recomputes from
  whatever's currently on disk.
- September 2026 — **ANTs dependency removed** — MIST's image I/O,
  preprocessing, postprocessing, evaluation, analysis, and inference now run
  entirely on SimpleITK; `antspyx` is no longer a dependency at all. A
  six-stage migration, each stage verified against real trained models
  (pocket nnU-Net, FMGNet, SwinUNETR-small) across a full 2-GPU H100 pipeline
  run before shipping.
- July 2026 — **Probability-level ensembling** — `mist_predict --output-probs`
  writes each model's final softmax probability volume alongside its discrete
  prediction; `mist_ensemble --input-type probabilities` averages probability
  volumes from separately trained models before a single argmax, preserving
  confidence information that STAPLE/majority vote discard.
- July 2026 — **Parallel ensembling** — `mist_ensemble` now accepts
  `--num-workers-ensemble` to combine predictions across patients in parallel
  worker processes.
- July 2026 — **Interactive Colab demo** — run the full MIST pipeline end-to-end
  on a free Colab GPU with the
  [heart segmentation notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mist-medical/MIST/blob/main/examples/mist_heart_demo.ipynb):
  analysis, training, evaluation, inference, postprocessing, and BraTS-style
  ranking, all in the browser with no local setup.
- June 2026 — **Official Docker image** — `mistmedical/mist:latest` ships a CUDA
  12.8 build. Requires NVIDIA driver ≥ 525.x.
- June 2026 — **2.0.1 release candidate** — BF16 automatic mixed precision
  replaces FP16 throughout training and inference, reducing memory use and
  eliminating gradient loss scaling. Sliding-window inference gains a tunable
  `sw_batch_size` parameter. `mist_rank` adds pairwise Wilcoxon significance
  testing via `--significance-csv`. Several targeted memory-reduction fixes land
  across the inference stack.
- June 2026 — **Multi-model ensembling** — `mist_ensemble` combines discrete
  NIfTI predictions from two or more separately trained models into a single
  consensus segmentation via STAPLE (`--ensemble-backend staple`, default) or
  majority vote (`--ensemble-backend majority_vote`). Works for single-class and
  multi-class label maps.
- May 2026 — **2.0.0 release candidate** — BraTS-style multi-strategy ranking
  (`mist_rank`), a structured postprocessing transform registry with
  LLM-readable metadata (`describe_transforms`), and full pathlib + PEP 585/604
  modernization across the codebase.
- April 2026 — **CPU inference support** — `mist_predict` now runs on any
  machine, including Macs and laptops without an NVIDIA GPU. Install with
  `pip install mist-medical` (no GPU required).
- March 2026 — **Resume training** — interrupted runs can be continued from the
  last checkpoint with `--resume`, with atomic checkpointing to prevent
  corruption.
- March 2026 — **GPU-aware automatic patch size** — the analysis step now
  derives the patch size from available GPU memory, so the default configuration
  is hardware-appropriate without manual tuning.
- March 2026 — **Transfer learning** — initialize encoders from pretrained
  weights with `--pretrained-weights`, and average model weights across folds
  with `mist_average_weights`.
- March 2026 — **Better training defaults** — AdamW optimizer and gradient
  clipping are now the defaults, with the clipping threshold exposed via
  `grad_clip_norm` in `config.json`.
- September 2025 —
  **[BraTS 2025 adult glioma challenge @ MICCAI 2025](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn64153130/wiki/633062)**
  — MIST takes 3rd place (repeat).
- November 2024 — **MedNeXt models** — small, base, medium, and large variants
  added (`mednext-small`, `mednext-base`, `mednext-medium`, `mednext-large`).
- October 2024 —
  **[BraTS 2024 adult glioma challenge @ MICCAI 2024](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn53708249/wiki/630150)**
  — MIST takes 3rd place.
