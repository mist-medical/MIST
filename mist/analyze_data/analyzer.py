"""Analyzer class for MIST.

This module contains the Analyzer class, which is responsible for analyzing
the dataset and preparing the configuration file for MIST. It checks the
dataset information, validates the dataset, checks if cropping to the
foreground bounding box is beneficial, checks the non-zero ratio of the images,
determines the target spacing, checks the resampled dimensions, and computes
the normalization parameters for CT images if applicable. It also saves the
configuration file and the paths dataframe to the results directory, which will
be used for preprocessing and training models.
