"""DataDumper class for MIST.

This module produces a rich statistical summary of the dataset that goes
beyond MIST's heuristic configuration analysis. The summary is intended to
give LLM-based agents the detailed context they need to reason about model
architecture, loss function, and training configuration choices.

Two output files are saved to the results directory:
    - data_dump.json: Full structured statistics (machine-readable).
    - data_dump.md: Narrativized summary optimized for LLM consumption.
