    """Compute lesion-wise metrics following the BraTS evaluation protocol.

    Each GT lesion above the volume threshold is matched to overlapping
    prediction components via dilation. Unmatched predicted components are
    counted as false positives (FP). The aggregate score penalizes both
    undetected GT lesions (FN) and FPs:

        score = sum(per_lesion_scores) / (num_gt_above_thresh + num_fp)

    FN lesions contribute 0 (Dice / surface Dice) or the image diagonal
    (HD95) to the numerator. Each FP contributes 0 (Dice / surface Dice)
    or the image diagonal (HD95) to the numerator, and 1 to the denominator.

    Args:
        pred: Binary prediction mask.
        gt: Binary ground truth mask.
        spacing: Voxel spacing in mm (dx, dy, dz).
        metrics: Metrics to compute. Supported values: 'dice', 'haus95',
            'surface_dice'.
        min_lesion_volume: Minimum GT lesion volume in mm³ to include.
            Lesions below this threshold are excluded from analysis.
        surface_dice_tolerance_mm: Tolerance in mm for surface Dice.
        dilation_iters: Dilation iterations used when searching for
            predicted components that overlap a GT lesion.
        gt_consolidation_iters: Dilation iterations for GT lesion
            consolidation before analysis. GT lesions whose dilated
            footprints connect are merged into a single lesion. Set to 0
            (default) to skip consolidation. Set equal to dilation_iters
            to replicate BraTS-style consolidation.
        reduction: Aggregation mode.
            - 'mean': BraTS-style sum / (num_gt_above_thresh + num_fp).
            - 'none': Return raw per-lesion result dicts (for debugging).

    Returns:
        If reduction == 'none': List of per-lesion result dicts, one per
            GT lesion above the volume threshold.
        If reduction == 'mean': Dict mapping metric name to aggregated
            score. Returns an empty dict when the denominator is zero (no
